    documentation="The essential concept of cloud computing is that IT resources are made available, within an environment that enables them to be used, via a communications network, as a service.&#xA;&#xA;The authoritative definition by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) says that:&#xA;&#xA;“Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” [NIST CLOUD DEFINITION]&#xA;&#xA;This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. The five essential characteristics are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. The three service models are Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The four deployment models are private cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud.&#xA;&#xA;The Open Group Cloud Ecosystem Reference Model [CLOUD RM] defines the major actors in cloud computing and their relationships and a minimum set of architecture building blocks. It incorporates the essential NIST definitions, and adds a fourth service model: Business Process as a Service (BPaaS). The figure shows the business roles and cloud services of the Cloud Ecosystem Reference Model without the architecture building blocks, to present cloud computing in a comparable way to other technologies in this Snapshot."/>
