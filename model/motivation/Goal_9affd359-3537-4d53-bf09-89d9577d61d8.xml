    documentation="Azure Kubernetes Service is the quickest path from zero to Kubernetes on Azure. This new service features an Azure-hosted control plane, automated upgrades, self-healing, easy scaling, and a simple user experience for both developers and cluster operators. With AKS, customers get the benefits of open source Kubernetes without complexity or operational overhead.&#xA;&#xA;To help you get started with AKS, the managed Kubernetes service is free. You only pay for the VMs in your cluster, and any infrastructure resources consumed like storage and networking. This means on Azure, you will pay nothing for the management of your Kubernetes cluster.&#xA;&#xA;AKS is currently available for Linux virtual machines.&#xA;&#xA;Creating an AKS cluster typically takes a few minutes. Once complete, you can access and manage your cluster through &quot;az aks&quot; and &quot;kubectl&quot;."/>
