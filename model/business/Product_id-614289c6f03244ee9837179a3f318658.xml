    documentation="Improve Customer Experience and Reduce Claims Leakage&#xA;&#xA;Cogito for Claims uses AI-based Natural Language Understanding to help insurers cut fraudulent claims payouts and leakage, speed customer and broker response, and respond to surges in claim volume without increasing headcount.&#xA;&#xA;Reading unstructured medical reports and claims documentation to extract essential details is tedious work that can now be automated. As a result, more documents can be included in claims analysis, and with higher accuracy.&#xA;&#xA;The outcome is more fraud signals identified, more medical data considered, and more claims given scrutiny rather than simply paying by default. And with the most time consuming task automated, claim response is cut to a fraction, creating a faster response for improved customer and broker experiences.&#xA;&#xA;White Paper: https://expertsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Expert-System-White-Paper-Applying-NLU-AI-to-Complex-Insurance-Problems.pdf"/>
