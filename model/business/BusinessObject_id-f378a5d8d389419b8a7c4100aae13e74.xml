Cutting research time produces underwriting offers ahead of the competition, winning more business.  When peak demand occurs, Cogito scales document input, allowing existing human experts to meet underwriting demand.&#xA;&#xA;By automating document understanding, Cogito enables insurance professionals to focus on the highest-value areas of their jobs.&#xA;&#xA;White paper: https://expertsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Expert-System-White-Paper-Applying-NLU-AI-to-Complex-Insurance-Problems.pdf"/>
