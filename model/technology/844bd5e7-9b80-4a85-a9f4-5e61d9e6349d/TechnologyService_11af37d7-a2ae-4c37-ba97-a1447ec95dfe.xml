Optimize costs with tiered storage for your long-term data, and flexibly scale up for high-performance computing and machine learning workloads.&#xA;&#xA;Scalable, durable, and available&#xA;Sixteen nines of designed durability with geo-replication and flexibility to scale as needed&#xA;&#xA;Secured&#xA;Authentication with Azure Active Directory and role-based access control (RBAC), plus encryption at rest and advanced threat protection&#xA;&#xA;Optimized for data lakes&#xA;File namespace and multi-protocol access support enabling analytics workloads for data insights&#xA;&#xA;Comprehensive data management&#xA;End-to-end lifecycle management, policy-based access control, and immutable (WORM) storage&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Build powerful cloud-native applications&#xA;Blob storage is built from the ground up to support the scale, security, and availability needs of mobile, web, and cloud-native application developers. Use it as a cornerstone for serverless architectures such as Azure Functions. Blob storage supports the most popular development frameworks, including Java, .NET, Python, and Node.js, and is the only cloud storage service that offers a premium, SSD-based object storage tier for low-latency and interactive scenarios.&#xA;&#xA;Store petabytes of data, cost-effectively&#xA;With multiple storage tiers and automated lifecycle management, store massive amounts of infrequently or rarely accessed data in a cost-efficient way. Replace your tape archives with Blob storage and never worry about migrating across hardware generations.&#xA;&#xA;Azure Data Lake Storage is a highly scalable and cost-effective data lake solution for big data analytics. It combines the power of a high-performance file system with massive scale and economy to help you speed your time to insight. Data Lake Storage extends Azure Blob Storage capabilities and is optimized for analytics workloads.&#xA;&#xA;Scale up for HPC or out for billions of IoT devices&#xA;Blob storage meets the demanding, high-throughput requirements of HPC applications while providing the scale necessary to support storage for billions of data points flowing in from IoT endpoints.">
